# DS cookiecutter

A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science that is package and maintable as software

## To get started

Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:

- Python 3.7+
- Cookiecutter Python package >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip or conda.

To install cookiecutter:

`$ pip install cookiecutter`

To get cookiecutter:

`$ python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/Borg93/ds_cookiecutter
`

## Trunk at Scale

This cookiecutter supports the development style Trunk-Based Development (TBD) to enable DS-package which can be reused between projects.

## Package versioning

Package version
PEP0440 compatible formatted version, see:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/

Generic release markers:
X.Y.0 # For first release after an increment in Y
X.Y.Z # For bugfix releases

Admissible pre-release markers:
X.Y.ZaN # Alpha release
X.Y.ZbN # Beta release
X.Y.ZrcN # Release Candidate
X.Y.Z # Final release

Dev branch marker is: 'X.Y.dev' or 'X.Y.devN' where N is an integer.
'X.Y.dev0' is the canonical version of 'X.Y.dev'

For instance:
X increments -> Incompatible w/ previous versions and has foundational changes
Y incremnts -> Adding functionality, but still backwards compatible
Z increments -> Backwards compatible and focuses on bug fixes (i.e Defects that are in production)
