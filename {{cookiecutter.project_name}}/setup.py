# ## Package versioning

# Package version
# PEP0440 compatible formatted version, see:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/

# Generic release markers:
# X.Y.0 # For first release after an increment in Y
# X.Y.Z # For bugfix releases

# Admissible pre-release markers:
# X.Y.ZaN # Alpha release
# X.Y.ZbN # Beta release
# X.Y.ZrcN # Release Candidate
# X.Y.Z # Final release

# Dev branch marker is: 'X.Y.dev' or 'X.Y.devN' where N is an integer.
# 'X.Y.dev0' is the canonical version of 'X.Y.dev'

# For instance:
# X increments -> Incompatible w/ previous versions and has foundational changes
# Y incremnts -> Adding functionality, but still backwards compatible
# Z increments -> Backwards compatible and focuses on bug fixes (i.e Defects that are in production)
